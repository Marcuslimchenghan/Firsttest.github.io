<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>
Silverbook University started as a old abandoned office building in the center of Malaysia in 2022.<br>
 person who bought the building, which is called Jeff Ochoa, is a teacher who was teaching at one of the most prestigious universities in the world.<br>
 students like his classes as he tries to make each class entertaining and fun. But he decided to leave his teaching position at 2021<br>
make his dreams of building a university come true. He wanted to make his dream come true is because<br>
was fed up with how much enrollment cost and also how the students were not enjoying university life.<br.
he decided to make his own university that is cheaper compared to other universities and also to make sure that the students wouldn't have to be stressed.<br>
bought the abandoned building in the center of Malaysia in 2022 with the help of his friends.<br>
after buying the building, he went to do many renovations to the building and completed them in 2024.
