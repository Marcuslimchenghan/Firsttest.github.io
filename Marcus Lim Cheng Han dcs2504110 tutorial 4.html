<p>
A <big><i><b>shepherd</big></i></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the field near the forest. He felt the job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <big><i><b>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</big></i></b>
</p>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <s>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</s>

The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub>S again.</font> So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
